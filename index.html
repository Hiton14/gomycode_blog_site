                        Erik ten Hag will pit his wits against Liverpool's new manager Arne Slot at the weekend in the
                        final match of Tour 2024, presented by Snapdragon.

                        The Manchester United boss will face his fellow Dutchman for the first time since Slot replaced
                        Jurgen Klopp in the Anfield job. The second occasion will be at Old Trafford next month in the
                        Premier League (Sunday 1 September, 16:00 BST).

                        This clash between English football's greatest rivals takes place in South Carolina, starting at
                        00:45 BST on Sunday morning, with the action live on MUTV.

                        The boss was also asked directly about Amass, who started the 3-2 win over Real Betis last time
                        out, assisting our opening goal for Amad.

                        "We have to make progress but we all see here a potential where we have seen in previous years,"
                        admitted Ten Hag.

                        "For instance, two years ago, [Alejandro] Garnacho last season. We had it during last season
                        with Kobbie [Mainoo], but he is not that far now at this moment.

                        "Yet, if we train him well, if we coach him well, then, in three months, it's possible that he
                        can be on that point. But, in this moment, he needs to catch up and he has to develop some
                        skills already to play for Manchester United, competing for the highest positions in the league.

                        "But, with big talent, it can go up very quickly and that is very interesting to see if he is
                        capable of doing this."

                    <p class="mb-2">
                        Denmark forward Rasmus Hojlund has had a meteoric rise at club and international level since making his professional debut at the age of 17.

Rasmus played academy football for Horsholm-Usserod Idraetsforening and Brondby, before eventually landing at his hometown club, FC Copenhagen, where he began to make an impact. He broke into the first team in October 2020 and finished his first season with a handful of senior appearances including four in Denmark's Superligaen.

Hojlund went on to play 32 times for FC Copenhagen, scoring five goals â€“ two of these coming in the Europa Conference League. He also collected his first winner's medal after helping Jess Thorup's side to claim the 2021/22 Superligaen title.

                        Bruno Fernandes took an unusual path to the top when compared to other Portuguese talents who
                        have served Manchester United.

                        While the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Nani made their names in Portugal, Fernandes spent the
                        first five years of his career in Italy.

                        A youth product at Boavista, the midfielder signed for Serie B club in Novara in August 2012, at
                        the age of 17. Initially suffering from homesickness, he eventually grew into his new
                        environment,
                        teaching himself Italian and helping the Blues to fifth position, before joining Udinese in
                        Italy's top tier.

                Our Old Trafford stadium, commonly known as "The Theatre of Dreams," was originally opened on February 19, 1910 with a capacity of approximately 80,000. During the Second World War, Old Trafford was used by the military as a depot, and on March 11, 1941 was heavily damaged by a German bombing raid. The stadium was rebuilt following the war and reopened on August 24, 1949. The addition of floodlighting, permitting evening matches, was completed in 1957 and a project to cover the stands with roofs was completed in 1959. After a series of additions during the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s, capacity at Old Trafford reached 56,385 in 1985. The conversion of the stadium to an all-seater reduced capacity to approximately 44,000 by 1992, the lowest in its history. Thereafter, we began to expand capacity throughout the stadium, bringing capacity to approximately 58,000 by 1996, approximately 68,000 by 2000, and approximately 76,000 in 2006. Current capacity at Old Trafford is 75,454.
